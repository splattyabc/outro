## How to use
Make sure you have python installed, you can do this by going to command prompt, then typing "py" then pressing enter. Your result should look something like this (it will have other information):

Python 3.10.5
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

If it does not, you can go to the Microsoft store, and download "Python 3.10", then repeat to make sure it has worked.

Now, you need to download vlc from here: https://download.cnet.com/VLC-Media-Player-64-bit/3000-13632_4-75761094.html

Next, download this repository. 

You can do this by first downloading git from here: https://gitforwindows.org. Then go to command prompt, and type "git clone https://github.com/splattyabc/outro" and press enter. The folder can then be found (by default) in C:/users/yourusername/outro.

Next, right click the "outro.py" file. There should be an option to "Edit with IDLE". Select this, then copy the path to the folder you have just downloaded, and paste it in the gap on the 5th line (there is some red text showing where it goes).

Now, just double click the python file and there you go!
